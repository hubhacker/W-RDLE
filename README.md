#**Remodeled Version of Wordle**

##**Difficulty Levels**
Unlike the original New York Times edition of Wordle, W∞RDLE offers different game modes depending on whether the user wants to be more challenged or relaxed.

##**Visually Improved**
W∞RDLE takes the layout of Wordle and adds different visually pleasing color palettes to ease the eyes of user. This includes our color themes peachy, winter worderland, and into the words.

##**Unlimited Words**
As anyone who is familiar with Wordle would know, it’s limited to once per day. For those who wish to continue playing with more words, W∞RDLE allows them to go as long as they desire.
